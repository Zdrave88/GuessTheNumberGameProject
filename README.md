# GuessTheNumberGameProject
My first project: Guess The Number Game. 

This is a console-based number-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game starts with Level 1, where the player guesses a number between 1 and 100, with 7 attempts. If the player guesses correctly, they can choose to play again or proceed to Level 2. In Level 2, the player must guess a number between 1 and 200, with only 5 attempts. After each game, the player has the option to restart the game from Level 1 or continue playing at Level 2.

Key features:

Multiple Levels: The game features two difficulty levels with different ranges and attempts.

Retry Option: After each game, the player can choose to replay or exit.

Input Validation: The game ensures the player enters valid numbers within the range.
