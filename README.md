# GuessTheNumberGameProject
My first project: Guess The Number Game. This is a simple console-based number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a predefined range and limited number of tries. The game features two levels, each with increasing difficulty:

How It Works: Level 1: The player has 7 attempts to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each incorrect guess, the program gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

Level 2: If the player successfully completes level 1 or wants to start directly from level 2, the game becomes more challenging: The player has to guess a number between 1 and 200.Only 5 attempts are available.

Game Over: After using all attempts in either level, the player is given the option to start a new game or exit.

Play Again: Upon winning or losing, the player can choose to restart the game or proceed to the next level.
